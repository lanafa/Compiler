# Chez-Compiler Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **Chez-Compiler** that compiles a large subset of Scheme into Intel x86, 64-bit assembly language. The generated assembly code is then assembled into a standalone executable using the Newtide Assembler (nasm). The project was developed as part of the **Compilation course at Ben-Gurion University (2022/2023, Semester 1)**. A custom tester was created to assist in verifying the functionality of the compiler.

## Assumptions
- The project is designed to run on **GNU/Linux** (this has not been tested on Windows).
